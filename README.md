# sudoku-solver

This is a sudoku solver built with python3/pygame. It allows user to solve it him/herself or use automatic solver that uses backtraknig algorithm.

## Instructions

Run with `python3 main.py`

When you run program with python3 main.py, program will start and there will be a default sudoku pattern. You can delete it by pressing RESET button. At first, you can add numbers to grid by selecting square and keyboard number buttons. If you want to delete a number you should select it first, and then push BACKSPACE. The numbers that are not locked will have blue rectangle around it, otherwise it will be red .After you think you are done, you can lock the numbers to start solve yourself or to use auto solver. Currently there is no animation to show solving algorithm smootly, but I plan to add it in future.
